# Ghost Samurai

Ghost Samurai is a 3D third-person combat game prototype developed in Unity. Inspired by titles like Sekiro (but without the parry/block system... for now!), this project focuses on delivering satisfying melee combat with a minimalist approach. You play as a lone warrior navigating intense one-on-one battles against enemy AI.

# 🔧 Features (so far):

➤ 👤 Playable samurai character with movement abilities like walk, run, dodge, roll, and block/parry

➤ ⚔️ Combat system including normal slashes, heavy attacks, riposte, and input queuing

➤ 🤖 Enemy AI with simple attack and chase behavior

➤ 🎮 Built from scratch in Unity as a solo developer project

# 🎯 Why this project?

This is a personal learning project that I’ve been working on after college hours and weekends. It’s helping me improve my skills in:

➤ Character movement and animation handling

➤ AI logic and behavior design

➤ Designing and implementing melee combat systems

➤ Unity workflows and prototyping

The goal isn’t perfection — it’s progress. This prototype is an ongoing exploration of how to make melee combat feel intense, responsive, and fun.
